Misty@dissapointed : "but still Ms Sabrina so scornfully repellend Marc you know he's still her only relative nevertheless.."
Ash@straight : "the bigger question though compeer is that first he rejected your.. appreciation for his inclinations as you.."
Misty@angry : "shut up you b.. he's way better than you at handling emotions of losing something#.."
Ash@happy : "this reminds me something you see in the battle i only devised a scheme where it was un ill favoured match for Ms Birch because you never win against a Lokix if you're using an Goodra you see as then you expect the Bug to find a way to get under your skin so that you can trap it in the long run but the psychic enthusiasm that needs to be present for that is only going to be darkened by the illusion..shh..of your poise..sometimes it feels better just ot good enough to be on top of self something you'd agree..shh..only upon retrospective parity.."
Misty@very Angry : "shut up you b.. how dare you challenge my inclinations#.."
Ash@happy : "it's almost midnight compeer why don't you come over to Sabrina's cabin along Marc giving a false alarm even if he suspects your motives he fails to overcome logic and coincidence even if not emotion..shh..so quantifiable.."
Misty@frown : "you do it yourself i'm not a deceitful cheat in such an occasion so perfect for emotional blackmailing and no i'm not going to stay there either bye.."
Ash@shrug : "what is this strange idea of evaluatory morality despite overseeing Mr Slatr#.."
Brock@scowl : "a tribute to all pervasiveness night#.."
Ash@shrug : "fair enough the least inflected..shh..yet only as me#..now the trap will test not only emotion but also security..(happy)..shh..so unmonitored unless for emotional casualties..right..

Sabrina,Marc+Misty,Brock@scowl : "what created the commotion of shadowy figures and what forced the bond of souls to surpass the hype of suspense's own#.."
Ash@happy : "you're only going to find clues Gyre just as them while neglecting the fact that i'm ever haunted by selfs in terms of probable identities for one and each..on the wheels of truth it's only the more manifest where trivial facts become projected as desire paramount..
thus neither the Ceruledges or Armarogues or Machamps and so on nor the motions of what actually was moving nor the desires what proved to be only self deceiving would've seemed to be..shh..self counterin'..and Team Sic failed to understand it wasn't at all them who were pulling the strings rather their mere..desire to be just as mot them their selves..the more metaphorical is reality as is the legendary forward claim.."
üê∫@scowl : "for the rest than me in terms of self it's the same me a result of being left ever free by the self countering hope and hopelessness rendering theleftover me ever free cunning indeed Ash apnei you're still under the purview of evaluatory tax having come in relativity thus our endeavours rhyming.."
Ash@shrug : "well i declared first up still Gyre unless only you would POPULARIZE do i have to be me..shh..through the comis of seein'..Phantom : The Meaning of Lie.."

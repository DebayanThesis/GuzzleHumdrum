Shay(singing) : "Dialga don't be a gambler..just roll the dice/whichever side comes up..possibility models as right/thus look aside not forward..as the later is the former's stride/to be holistic thus me,existence you now vanish in thy plight.."
Kimberly(sinhing) : "Second order staying for the returning some page/that was known..oh towards..convert your self unknown to repechage/thus surrender acceptance discernment is in the hands of new/attention spontaneous only..if i'm no more qualia's you.."
Shay(similar) : "i have got the whole of the essence..of my band
thus oh you don't try to win..over my rational land
hence to convey the order..look my's sand
flies randomly in the wind of thy..to determined limits of i's definitional land.."
Kimberly(similarly) : "thus feeling you stay at..home of none/asked if that alas..becomes me pun/of i or observer..of the conincidence's land/Ocean you be existence..else me only Insistence's incidence on my can.."
Shay+Kimberly(happy) : "Oh Dialga thus don't you try to battle..what's defined as the lie that's called what's not as that..Dark you be Light..for Consciousness's lack#..The Backend Ones,#,.."

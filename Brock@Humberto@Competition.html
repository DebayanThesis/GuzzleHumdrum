Brock(smile) : "a competition compeers hence must be completely fair that requires no benefits but cumulation..the lonelier you are in degree or state the more is your cumulative freedom to be any self..that feeling of competence for that feeling of essence..the most changing as in the gap between states as Jolly said#..Jolly On-Roam,#.."
Humberto(frown) : "so how will the competition take place.."
Brock(smile) : "previously compeer after 21.75 that is after graduating one is required to travel the home region of graduation for 4 years then submit the pokemons they contacted which then is distributed with a link to the person throughout that region and then this test takes 1 year then in the leftover 3 years 6 months is reserved for facilitating the previous 5 years so in the leftover 2.5 years the institute the city the block the section the region and finally the interregional competition takes place each takes 2 months with a month break within on who can demonstrate the best with random connected pokemons and a winner is determined unanimously it can only be either 1 or 2 in case of draw so finally this winner at 29.75 takes over a post et Elite4 which runs the whole system in collaboration with Pokemon Facilitation Smogons which owns the labs and these are owned by regional administration policed by self imposition made just by assurance of this feeling of that indeed in consideration#..Leading Crook,#,..so the losers gets to keep everything with a payscale difference as in a job and so on but there's internal promotion that is self constraining as if that itself doesn't feel so#.. hence this system is always recurring compeer thus definition always eludes it being confused with the feeling of where#..Dashin' Rock,#,..so now this competition compeer is indeed peer to peer as Dr Oak has put forward his system of professional action#..so accordingly we as part of the Sanctuary#..The Sanctuary of Strawberry Facepalm,#,..has come up with this resolution that we'll be visiting randomness at sampled random the feeling that is assuring no such feeling as pseudo-random#..Feeling Crook,#,..so we'll compete as in for 8 years since 21.75 that is labs will conserve each wild convergence points and invite people having graduated to work for them who will accordingly work and thus the pokemon will choose 1 to any at random according to random's reflecting feeling in consultation to their and it's being#..now this ownership means those who won't won will be the responsibility of these people because they've shown they can have less ego may be only at the cost of others else this showcase is only that feeling of determination..the most oscillating between similarity and it's self differentiating-both of similarity's self the subjects's self and own self- thus self defining thus self insulating meaning as Jolly would say countering#..Vagabonds of Usage,#.."
Humberto(scowl) : "and that dreg of consideration's self denial Goy#..that lowlife will sponsor this including himself hum#.."
Brock(smile) : "that's within this system compeer this system is sponsored by Dr and Mrs Oak alone as they're not mentionable by any help#..The Professional Ones,#.."
Humberto(scowl) : "i see..but you want me to believe your most seminal work Hand-picked that is Project Baby Dawn that brat will follow any rules unless that admit it's existence#..Baby Dawn Groudon,#..and you've given that brat so much pampering and indulgence that pest is visiting random meetings why hum#..Baby Dawn Groudon,#..and these meetings are always held on parks and etc in random groups who always for Dawnny to appear will be about to fall from their objective of actual aim as in the meeting not it's resolution but the ongoing procedure of actuation else it's only a work division that is ensured by the involution Mango..shuu..wait to fall then no more will itself befall#..and this brat has been hand-picked by Dr Oak rest irrelevant#..Dr Oak Dr Oak,#,..what does the inferred ones want hum,#..The Inferred Ones,#,..Magnus+Dawn un..long,#.."
Brock(smile) : "Inference compeer they can't find it unless they are but that's you are only compeer as in the self of are as in ok that as in you are if confusion can't any more surrender as a relationship between whatever as that too is ok are as in yeah You Are#..Confuse Sack,#.."

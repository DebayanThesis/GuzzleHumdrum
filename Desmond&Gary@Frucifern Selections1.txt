..(Desmond with Gary@Oak Labs)..
Desmond(laughing) : "well Gary i only have one thing lastly to ask you before tomorrow finally the executions begin at that crematorium(all burst..)..that is Ash won't be involved in it he said but i thought rather it will be Stashey(all laugh..lot).."
Gary(laughing..) : "no Niji is most loved among them being the youngest the disciple brats too adhere to this you know the relationship both sets rather love each other too much thus that relationship in duality in reality each are absolutely same(all laugh..lot) hence they're going to completely wrap Niji up in absolute cotton wool and you know it means countering only Shadowy Lantern is an impossible creature for creation all together(all burst..,..Gary..Weather Chat,#)..Devout Ration thus best left unnoticed cause that's ever a notch ahead to validate the methods as part of deal#..but Ivtie will be wrapped by Zed as Zee doesn't need any as you know having the human experience for 3 months that too continuous#..Jolly On-Roam,#..rest don't know how to behave personally hence will do so according to order(all un..long)..Zed is the eldest among them so he obviously has to know#..and Stashey is impossible to control unless his bigger sis who if paired with her elder pro will never allow the others to operate Simile Popcorn and Daily Hologram aren't physically violent these two mostly are that is Niji Lastly Phantom has 0 reaction to everything#..they have so much love between them thus it manifests and this time due to the arrangement Ash won't react physically at all which will incense Niji even more#..hence Guzzle Humdrum is replaced cause firstly outside you know what will happen Guzzle Humdrum won't have any patience to bear all those hence it will be a massive problem for them physically just cause according to my experiences he can single-handedly vaporize the best of Kanto army without using any word or thought that physique is only the tip of iceberg and can do miracles in his mind he's 18 inch 16.26 kg and you can calculate the multipliers#..this brat just isn't agile while moving countering obviously#..if they go close to him cause no weapons will listen to them as they by not being them will create a Humdrum#..anyway#..then they have to go close and say like 100 will go they won't be able to match his speed at all cause it's going to reflect them only exactly as a baby plays#..and he sparred with horrendous creatures i saw once a pure fire legend whose name you better not know#..and no it was without flames and optimal power but both were acting like siblings#..and their optimal power is determined according to psychic capacity hence this physique isn't at all what it seems to be it's only a mockery of standards including the lack of limits as countering#..anyway first time i saw him was the second month rest themselves didn't go i was curious so stepped inside a strange looking cave like whatever it was just existing#..then i don't know where i was there was only differences#..then i saw him was of small proportions like the rest but was all alone and was sitting sometimes moving only the upper body sometimes doing the stances them sometimes was rolling around in too much glee#..then i knew his name so like called him like,um.. excuse me from i but um..are you Stash#..the reply was(laughing..),Just That's..is the apostrophe used properly or did the meaning made it against usage clash#..i knew i better leave#..but before i could do anything this brat came beside me rolling is terrible speed#..then looked at me now his face is way prettier#..then didn't have any face only if i thought it was#..then i said um do i disturb you being absent from tense vs sequence conservation#..by then he was sitting on my shoulders i didn't know how i was standing within any trouble despite feeling like it was a solid rock#..then he was swinging his legs which again was there only if i didn't know them#..and then i kept quite cause he i guessed wouldn't answer or I didn't recognize his language#..exactly when i had thought about all these said common-sense compeer is conserved in self..shh..the most entrepreneuring#..i kinda automatically said commonness of sense i guess,said that's open to interpretation alas it helps,countering#..then again remained silent but was violently hitting my chest with his feets yet i felt despite this like it was just a baby#..so i said um..do  you stay here always#..if only someone may quest the answer not space#..i again automatically said the question will then have to change according to knowledge instantiated i guess#..countering yeah why would you bother to say this now not at the end#..quest they should compeer but it's only a fare of best among consciousness and existence isn't it#..so i now understood this brat is the conception of all the Opportunists combined and is indeed rarest of all#..anyway i felt a bit discomforted cause i was seeing somethings but i didn't know what they were or the feelings i felt I didn't know if i felt to start with what to speak of what sort of feelings#..so i said may i go now said yeah remember the time you came in#..so i knew if i went out i would end up in another strange world#..so I didn't now he said i see you don't know what is what though know what some know only is some whole but not what it means#..some knows that too but not that it's only cause not due to what,what it is#..then said well if you want go remembering going then not want ofcourse#..so now i recalled Lil and returned if i recalled anything else like Mrs or Ms Lillie or Lillie flower i would've been gone#..but when i returned i understood again that that's the only thing left to recall too which my next version has assimilated just as new as well just as the other half as self-reflex enabling cue not intelligence-reflective phew#..The Feathered Ones,#..anyway none seemed to bother though of my whereabouts so i returned and all with them now at Hibiscusmost border there's a huge entourage of Police i see they said i was gone for 50 years#..i said look at yourselves they looked at me surprised saying you've not changed at all just as us just in case, i automatically said countering i guess#..they left happily later i found they were real people from the same time as well but it was like a dream that had happened like i was gone and a whole lifetime and so on Fowldung had been to the places by then of course#..they told him to tell me to enjoy the most#..so then i sometimes went but never if i was curious or reluctant or wanting only when the thoughts came i could go they were spontaneous but not linked to to process only access#..then i understood eventually which my other pros themselves did that Guzzle Humdrum doesn't need self at all just the random being#..so therefore he's more sought after inside but Lastly Phantom is an extremely sly creature Mr Desmond you've seen that no that is the level he never hides can't but there's no end to that at all#.."
Desmond(laughing..) : "well the level starts from lack of witness thus better be left there itself exactly why i send those polices away#..they were trying to physically confront him which wouldn't have ended up well cause they could never reach the want only action#..but Phantom's speciality i didn't understand#.."
Gary(laughing..) : "well this is the second most found among them first is of course Simile Popcorn#..but it has no patience only glee this one is opposite hence selected always by self due to lack of any of and or it#..in the Ridge only i was allowed cause they deemed me too sweetie#..so i can understand there's many more who should be allowed here too hence this arrangement#..the only teaching useful to their present physique is going to be ability to sing free vocals taught by Ms Volbeat#..Doctor Slate will be here too albeit not when Ms Volbeat is there else it'll be a serious problem for all of us#..The Unfolded Ones,#,no they know when the time is there it's only accidental love for something or being will make them cross each other physically which is never a pleasant thing at all they i was told behave such a way cause they want privacy of feelings in emotions if only seen through intelligence#..hence best left alone#..so we don't have to do anything if such cases happen only if they go too far we should separate them using The Pedantic Ones that's all#..only Lil won't be here will be at Cerulean Edu will manage Boulder with Gladie the baby pros will be there with us obviously#..Gladie of course isn't permitted by anyone#..but yeah Lastly Phantom will be a problem i tell you from before cause how they react to the lab because they aren't crossing anything behind witnessing#..Lillie..Lastly The Symbol Emulation,#..
Desmond(laughing) : "i just hope they don't try to understand what he says#..Lillie..Lastly The Denomination Reaction,#"

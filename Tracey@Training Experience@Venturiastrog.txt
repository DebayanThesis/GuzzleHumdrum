warning means this hideous leading pest became an absolute volcano#..hence out came Genesect now i said oh no finally an advantage(all burst..)..so now i set Veno out and knew it's not going to be good#..so i told the brat verbally to finish it quickly#..which the brat took as me being frustrated which confirmed it to the leading brat that first Scy was indeed right,second Venonat is stronger than him third i really was a fox of disguise yeah a terrible mistake walking in a gym(all un..long)..so#..now Veno stands for 6 minutes still was in full blown mode the advantage kept him up#..so now it takes 18 minutes full so i must be given a point and an admittance that she used with 2 warnings 2 pseudo-legends which made the leading pest go to absolute 7th hell(all burst..)..so i'm cursed and warned and kicked out without any physique involved thus straight zapped to exit(all burst..)..so i come out and applied for Juntru-Uboron labs while walking out#..so yeah that was all of my battling experience till those two headless Gyaradoses forced me to be their doormat#..

Layzal(laughing..) : "once i had to either forbear or revolt against memory..of..Conscious Trap#..Fictitious Fact,#,.."
Leah(smile) : "it's ok honey just.."
Layzal(frown,tendering Leah) : "this is enough mom..you don't have to stay.."
Odell(inebriated) : "you little brat..(hits Layzal).."
Leah(crying) : "no.."
Odell(bit puzzled) : "um.."
Saengdao : "in case you thought i was dead i concur with you indeed.. albeit not on what you just said..but rather to admit that you are not me..i do concur the trap of consciousness never knowing why it won't won't be..me..anything strange about..reality.."
Odell(crying out) : "no..this this.."
Pertinence(laughing..) : "don't be so scared compeers the insipid pale body complexion means fact,the bright yellow face means fiction,the light yellow hairs and inside mouth means trap,and the bright golden teeth and eyeball means consciousness..that is appearance as something else but just as me it's only an assumption of this as in you..it's called Saengdao meaning Starlight..a Fact of the Fiction that exactly this star is this one definitively..consciousness it counters why won't be exactly my thus showing it's entrapped in the loop of truth of unbinding proven to be a fictitious fact..just to be countering and nothing else.."
Saengdao : "but my point is that this exactly this is what is if either real of dual as in i..no..fair enough..i was the more..shh..correapondin'.."
Pertinence(laughing..) : "this thought of self to self voice is only to prove thoughts to be trapped as-is..enjoy the opportunity compeers, consciousness never undertood why it can't be alone#..Fictitious Fact,#,.."
Saengdao : "thus an happy family after 5 years of attempts.. don't try to find inheritance behind me compeers the tough life that you lead only has sprout this out..this fact..wish it was so..natural..why desire goes through hardship only..shh.. consciousness so self bemired.. anything proven..shh..as a brochure?.."
Cosmic@Outcry : "no!that self deluding intent has befallen us again just to prove our separation from it..um..no it was that again#.. Conscious Trap,#,.."
All(un..long) : "this is downright impossible..just that#..Conscious Trap,#,.."
Layzal(angry) : "no Sango wrote these strange worthless meaningless useless words instead of my math assignments i have submitted all else..i can do them again right away..no you can't penalize me without an opportunity to defend myself#..Layzal.. Fictitious Fact,#,.."

Desmond(frown) : "i see but as far as Mr Levon said Reverend Henna and Clarie we all know she's been a great custodian of justice throughout her career that only ended last year and it started right since i'm seeing her as a say 2 year old when she was in middle school still#..i've not seen her mess around even with me whose 12 years younger to her#..she is just normal but something must've send her back to the time that i can't attest to#.."
Henna(solemn) : "well i'm being told a story Mr Desmond just as i listen to you this i can do so smoothly both that is cause this story isn't starting or ending it's parallel to itself just like action and analysis and heuristics and decision with feeling and emotion and experience and perception with intelligence and rationality and induction and causation and so on so on#..and i'm now being told to add the most countering#..this story says someone took up sports cause he was bullied gets great at it becomes the best at it over a long span of time then enters his regions social activists ranks changes the society and authority then the whole world that he's part then the story says Mrs Clarie Asompor was parallel to this how the emotional upheavals and the feelings then it links with Mr Levon and how things play out how their bond is fair cause it's the no option solution but that is because of so much causal validation and so on so on..all of us here Mr Desmond are being thrown around as thoughts in my mind as we all travel across i don't know just me as a contemporary to now#..so it seems tense and space and being and ego and causal self and actual self and everything is just like hands-on indeed mr Devon out of our archives i only got one letter solution to this that's the termination criteria to start or to end choice is what is the solution-that is like choice is-Guzzle Humdrum,#..that if analyzed makes absolutely no sense barring illusion which it insinuates at in outlandish glee cause it claims this revelation is nuzzling his elusive me#..this has been cautioned multiple times Mr Desmond NOT to use the word hands-on at any time after retirement age if someone on a random day asked anyone at random if this one could be excused from self then proceeded to ask of a direction just understand the game of puns#..it can happen only with another's half present at very very, very specific situations during the whole existence sampled at random after a warning that Ms Punbolibe said a week earlier 10 days ago to be exact which are exactly similar to Ignu and Ruby which we did tell this to the concerned ones within 8 days from that so they were warned the same day Ms Punbolibe went forth infact just a couple of hours later at 9 in the morning#..as you know as a precaution but these two dregs of innocence#..have breached it the VERY next afternoon yesterday itself Mr Desmond what else Raul and Pia were the only only other two it happens in two days only so they were targetted too that day itself but they used the word on spot#..see now whose the real espionage masters#.."

Henna(solemn) : "be prepared all of you COMPEERS for this word of random brochure#.."
Hands-On(heard) : "shuu..the most redundant..countering illusion so abundant and insistent of this instance..countering Hands-On reliance.."
Desmond(solemn) : "no it's ok Reverend Henna you may go you have much work anyway now all the more#.."
Henna(irritated) : "no Mr Desmond these brats are going to be completely new for all of us though we'll be told about them the whole hands-on that's there's absolutely nothing to know at all cause it's hands-on countering self by self's loneliness's humdrum#..anyway best wishes,#.."
Desmond(solemn) : "best wishes,#..(angry)..Ignu you lowlife what is now the solution hum#.."
Ignacio(bit excited) : "oh Reverend Henna herself said the dimension of pokemons.."

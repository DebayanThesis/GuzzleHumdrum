Kumaglak(frown) : "this is my utmost strength ok either you're tapping or countering else i'll complain to Leah aunty#.."
Tantrum : "it's barring the emotions compeer the biggest of which will require a clear mind full of excretions so confessing#..A Random Tryrantum,#.."
Kumaglak(complaining to Leah who was present) : "saw aunty saw#.."
Leah(frown) : "Stashey don't ruin his career ok#.."
Tantrum : "i wonder compeer why you suffer from exhaustion of happiness#.."
Leah(frown) : "if Kumlie doesn't eat properly today after being invited to the dungeon you will NOT be allowed to sweep it BYE#..A Random Tryrantum,#.."
Tantrum : "just to be exhumed from my..this is why said compeer don't think you have to cook in time only in least wastage of suspicion#.."
Leah(from other place,frown) : "cleaning including the kitchen yeah#.."
A Coach(laughing..) : "this is the Suspicion of Justice Mrs Ketchum best wishes#..(smile)..but yeah) Randy's right on the last account Mi..yeah Ms Gubiras..(laughing)..Countering#..A Random Tryrantum,#,.."
Kumaglak(frown) : "Stashey this is lower middle school jokes of adolescence ok#.."
Tantrum : "transcendence to essence from reliance..shh..so hyped#..anyway Mr Otis Oarolor 3 times IRSGC champion in up-upon wrestling last time silver definitely you had to be distracted for some reason unbeknownst to the result i guess#.."
Otis(smile) : "most certainly Stashey and I don't know yet what was the exact reason nor do i believe i ever will.."
Tantrum : "the reason is black boxes compeer the same way Stash works for submission to entity and Randy works for definition of uncertainty#..A Random Tryrantum,#.."
Otis(laughing..) : "yeah in my PhD thesis i wrote that these are the acknowledgements in the law degree i wrote how i could challenge them still being my own, countering#..hence i named it-The Random Justice,#.."
Tantrum : "but do you prefer this Mr Otis to the sort of competition you were doing#.."
Otis(laughing..) : "well previously only emotions needed to be controlled now even sensations as to if this is a feeling no further progess can have any fruit to bear#..No Progress if Born,#,.."
Tantrum : "edgible by fair the causal fear indeed so countering#..so you see Kumlie as you're still holding me in a chokehold and i'm still talking i might do so mentally this environment Kumlie the physical interface the actualization of the spontaneous mental health..shh..so conjoinin'#..A Random Tryrantum,#,.."
Kumaglak(angry,getting off complaining) : "you brat i'm going to meet Pablo sir#.."
Otis(smile) : "your takedown wasn't perfect dear intact was lagging much in direction you were too bend over your knees hence this situation was created you can't make one mistake and try to compensate having known it in this situation it's reactions only your mind is not to think on but to provide thought as help.."
Tantrum(thumping..) : "Scientific#!..Mr Rubel Rimlonon you were the only to defeat Mr Oarolor in interregional competitions but you thought you won because of you being better that day emotionally not parametrically hence your situations were dire as opposed to him conservant to emotions not it's controls#.."
Rubel(laughing..) : "well as good as Mr Otis was atleast he accepted defeat smiling and gave me the gesture no matter i didn't understand his regional language so much which will be halted for your span of being one among heres as part of the poece i read which i thought must be said by beings at a far far worse mental state than mine as im 'Consultancy : A Revenge of Randomness'#..so i thought yeah ok i won I did the unthinkable and so on but someone like your compper-for-arms#..would've told me unthinkable is only the incidence of existence being sworn#..Incidence Insistence,#.."
Tantrum : "do you realize Kumlie that ambition is the assurance of regret#.."
Kumaglak(thoughtful) : "um..ok#..but(frown)..how have you known it Grappolcots don't use takedowns only maul downs..NOT ONLY MENTALLY#.."
Tantrum : "you were trying to be happy compeer when you shook my hands thinking they are against you alas for your hands a fallacy..shh..this fight for seclusion..so maddening,#.."
Kumaglak(angry) : "oh yeah i'll keep doing this till i get the best method.."
Tantrum : "not today compeer as you said your other half was upset at something you looked deep into the eyes as part of assurance against the uncertainty then enacted the physical form..shh..countering believability so including#..A Random Tryrantum,#.."
Kumaglak(scowl) : "i see and this is exactly why Noldie always complains to me that he's not given right medicines#..then said once someone out of blue said so i said um ok so did you two like hugged each other then or something the person said no but i said listen i'm trained to either drill through phenomena not through it or ascend from qualia not out of it#..so the person said ok how will you do the two so he complained that if medicine he would've been able to rationalize it and understand it but the earlier path leads to absolute duality which is impossible because it'll come back to self EACH time# the second technique is no reality which means birth is too unfortunate for proper death of an algorithm to perform a preset duty concurred through acuity the most recurring#..and Hertie always retorts atleast you're not out in a crematory too i was told then moment you see another next thought concurred#..A Random Tryrantum,#.."
Rubel(laughing..) : "well i wonder Randy why none but you are trying your hands at normalised normalcy#.."
Someone else(thoughtful) : "i know this i wanted to be close to some guy cause i had a crush on him but one day i thought of him when Randy was here he told me i was trying to find if his form matched mine which never will not psychologically#..so i became angry and said never emotionally either#..he said for that you first have to understand another how will you do it without me#..so this is why he likes this randomness Sir rest have a bit more patience for random's endurance even Raki#.."
Otis(laughing..) : "i see but Mr Branislav in the mat these brats are insurmountable i guess as in a clinch#.."
Branislav(frown) : "they have introduced completely wrong methods Mr Otis in stand-up games atleast in a mat they're never going to react#..if legs are allowed then the distance is always more and the clinch is disturbed but those clinches has more possibility but less damage to the head exactly why they're following Kommo-Os the most cause each dies from a fatal head injury#..and they're always trying to get hit on the back of head the illegal ones hence the clinch#..these brats arw obsessed with no being being Mr Otis whatever that means to self#..so they're encouraging these sort of things where there is competition without a biased result something that shrew has mastered and his involution doesn't understand particulars barring self cessation which is why is involuted#..The Unanimous Ones,#..and her younger pest and his brat are masteres of surrendering advantages of any situation to a model hence are terrible menaces to actuation of being#..The Uncanny Ones,#..but in team sports as you know they're i ducing Falinks life rest left out for sanity#..Vagabonds of Honesty,#.."

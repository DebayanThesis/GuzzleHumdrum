Gus : "the washroom compeer the washroom for a metaphysical jolter..many things compeer many things could be right even in human restrictions of sense faculties they if not imagination and work comes in as part of the brass ring but then each time that takes over spontaneities it's a deafeat..defeat of constraints isn't it constraint of survival spontaneity says what about this as so dear..so entrapping#..Format Optics,#..then eventually each moment each thought each percept..of what is thus and due to what's not..me oh you..boo#..Tracing Howling,#..but then determination comes in till next one when that itself is needed continuity only so when something satisfying is heeded..so detrimental..vision wise though of intention not according to it's with anything else relational#..Foregone Claps,#.."

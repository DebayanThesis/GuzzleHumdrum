üê∫(respectfully) : "if you could pardon my impatience respected ones.."
Pertinent People : "there's a way to control them compeer but impossible unless from the point of view of propriety or impotence due to the fact that relativity remains hence there's no escape from the Humdrum of essence as it would be added along with thus countering..for us we if keep them hanging after asking them something they'll be offended because they're robbed of their opportunity to counter themselves hence will counter the essence thus jump upon us with patience exactly when they're call enough to get assimilated but this process doesn't end not even in omniscience compeer but unlike relativity they'd be instantaneous there not spontaneous hence devoid of countering which is the way to counter their impatience there with absolute their complain is that the all compassion should've been stayed as that just so that they could have countered themselves the essence of that and obviously because that's illusion they're going to add countering.."

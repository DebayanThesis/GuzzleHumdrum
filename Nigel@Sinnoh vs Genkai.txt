Nigel(laughing..) : "well i get in and from the word go the brats refused to say or do or insinuate anything to Ultie no matter of his dragonic status#..so i was cautious and played my normal game but all rounds are 11 minutes barring the last two with the penultimate being Crawdaunt once 11th passed i firmly held myself from blinking(all burst..)..then next is Tyranitar i asked Ultie how's your family man(all burst..)..but this brat downright attacked Genkie at 9th minute(all burst..) so was like 10 minutes so ok i didn't know if i were countering grammar of mode by meaning of sense(all burst..),then ok it's only 2 hours and 24 minutes all were profusely throwing things at Genkie viciously disparaging him in elation though of(laughing..) 7,8(all un..long)..then ofcourse Chu comes in out of ball so from this itself the crowd abated i ofcouse changed Ultie before and i knew this isn't going to go down well cause he looked really like a madly cunning Rafstosmoric#..so i said ok first and foremost i'm going with triple advantage with pace to match#..so wanted Jirachi but only that curse of calculating knows who exchanged the balls to Rapidash(all burst..)..all were laughing at me now in 5 minutes they understood this is going to scrap all previous records#..anyway I can't change though i protested to buy time saying no something is wrong with the ball Bazu warns me either you behave else you're going home accused of substances#..so anyway the crowd anyway turned on me in 6/7 minutes i realized this all was to lull my ego just to be countering with own(all un..,Dawn..Column Jargon,#).. exactly what Rippie said#..and yeah with each passing minute this match from the beginning Dawnny was heinously swearing my poor beau for turning up ONLY for this match(all burst..,Dawn un..)..anyway i go in with Rippie and we're toyed for 61 minutes then i said well i lost 1 pokemon to 0 despite the score.card this is what that jackal or graphics taught absolutely being the ðŸ¦Š of Tactics#..ok next up first break where i only battled against thoughts#..next in i knew any chance to salvage a draw is to tire this brat up which for electrics the hardest to do even ghosts get tired no matter their potential increases with it#..exponentially not linearly for information#..but electrics either they're sent to next life else stays to send you to check for them first#..ok so i knew I can't use triple advantage this brat will get happier with one advantage it's a recipe for disaster#..same types i thought later rounds weakness no i don't want to be battled by my own brat their ultimate goal(all un..)..so ok i get double advantage first up Magearna#..gone second up Gothitelle gone third Runerigus gone this one truly broke Hizzi's spirit#..so break two now i fought against perceptions(all un..),ok# then get in i knew no change in strategy i was seeking Melody's blessings not all compassion(all burst..,Melody un..long)..then#..next up Hatterene next Diancie gone similarly but after Diancie i saw them too happy knew Doctor Slate will work against them finally#..so next in Tapu Lele is gone but now it's last break and i saw Chu a bit like showing some signs of a long outing#..so i remonstrated with Bazu to give me one more round he said of logic or cosmic hum(all un..)..so i went inside mannerly#..where i fought fruition(all un..long)..so#..then we come out and i set Lunala in now after the round finally Chu is tired so i set out Zearoa for blind race#..now that spectacle happens and i knew i got it because# surely they didn't want to show it so final 10 minutes Chu is really knackered now at 7th minute Ultie is barely standing but Chu is literally lying#..i asked Bazu why aren't you counting,profiting you meant i guess(all un..long)..so i politely returned to intelligence not senses(all un..) then for the second time consecutive rounds Chu first cons then psychs my brat and gets the win#..Dawnny flew in no not at the filed but i saw towards poor Hizzie#..then Genkie said there itself that this is not at all fair Zeraora ok we had to stick to our guns but this round definitely not i said yeah sadly i couldn't do what you were suggesting midmatch last round#..anyway then Bazu after this match says i'll take the full credit Genkie is penalized for underhand tactics which would've obsessed even the Frontier Fanatics#..so anyway it's a procedural melee the winner's baby sister's behaviour included#..but when all these were happening my brats were reminding me this is only the semis sonny what would you do tomorrow 7 mere hours left that is to face Correct Tactics#..i said this is my mental health prescription for anxiety cure thanks#"
